					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Hi, my name is Philip. I am currently a sophomore at Northwestern University, studying computer science. I have some experience with web development, entrepreneurship and big data. Currently, I am working with a Northwestern Professor, Douglas Downey, on a research project focused on data visualization.</p>
					<p>Aside from staring at my screen all day, I like to play basketball and go on spontaneous adventures with my friends.</p>

							<h2>Atlasify</h2>
							<h3>June 2014 - Present</h3>
							<p>Atlasify is a new way to visualize how different concepts are related: maps, periodic tables, and other reference systems. On the Atlasify project I worked on creating explanations between two search queries. My partner and I created a system that took two search concepts from a wikipedia api that Professor Downey had previously developed, and took small snippets of text from the top ranked shared inlinks. Initially this project was written in as a php app but we have since ported over to node.js environment.</p>
							<p>Technology Used: Node.js, python, mySQL, php, jade, express

							<h2>Wett</h2>
							<h3>December 2014</h3>
							<p>I developed a ruby on rails website for my class IEMS 225: Principles of Entrepreneurship. In this class we created companies, that had a unique business proposition. My team wanted to sell hawaiian t-shirts. Since we were selling our shirts through an e-commerce platform I decided to create the website for the group. Using rails an adminstrator can login into the system and check orders along with reading user comments.
							<p>Technology Used: Ruby on Rails, css, scss</p>

							<h2>TextDB</h2>
							<h3>November 2014</h3>
							<p>TextDB was a hackathon project that my friends and I worked on at Wildhacks 2014. The idea behind the project was to create a way to store data on the fly by configuring databases using 7 meta data tables using PostgreSQL. TextDB is a flask application that is also integrated with the Twilio API to allow users to text data via sms to their database keys. Users can then access this information online.</p>
							<p>Technology Used: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Boostrap</p>

							<h2>Project Pitch</h2>
							<h3>August 2014</h3>
							<p>Project Pitch is a quarter-long entrepreneurship development program that I run at Northwestern through EPIC.

This was my first web project and I learned a lot of basic tools used in web development such as javascript, css, php, and bootstrap.</p>
							<p>Technology Used: php, boostrap, javascript
